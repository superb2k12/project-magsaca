</hgroup>
              <p><strong>Agrikulturang Pilipino or Agri-Pinoy</strong> is the over-all strategic framework of the Department of Agriculture   that guide the various services and programs of the DA from 2011-2016   and beyond.</p>
              <p>Agri-Pinoy incorporates principles and   practices that optimize the development of Philippine resources, natural   and human, to achieve Philippine goals in agriculture and fisheries,   and contribute to national development.</p>
              <p>We rely mainly on lessons drawn from   Philippine experience, but we also learn from others, according to the   principle: &ldquo;Learn from others. Think for ourselves.&rdquo; While we focus on   our Philippine goals, we also contribute what we can toward the goals of   the global community, in the spirit of interdependence.</p>
              <p>This executive summary of Agri-Pinoy has three sections:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The four guiding principles of Agri-Pinoy</li>
                <li>The Agri-Pinoy checklist</li>
                <li>The challenges to the DA family</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Four Guiding Principles of Agri-Pinoy</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Food security and self-sufficiency</li>
                <li>Sustainable agriculture and fisheries</li>
                <li>Natural resource management</li>
                <li>Local development</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Food security and self-sufficiency.</strong> Agri-Pinoy seeks to meet the food needs of the Philippines,   particularly staple food, and make them accessible, affordable, safe and   nutritious. Sapat, ligtas, at abot-kayang pagkain sa lahat.</p>
              <p>In the pursuit of food security,   Agri-Pinoy seeks to minimize our dependence on food imports, especially   of staple food, by optimizing the development of the natural and human   resources of the Philippines, toward increased productivity and   increased incomes especially of primary producers.</p>
              <p>Agri-Pinoy promotes the principle of   food self-sufficiency with full awareness of our global interdependence,   and our various commitments international trade agreements. Our trade   policies and practices are integral to our efforts to achieve food   security and self-sufficiency.</p>
              <p>Sustainable agriculture and fisheries.   To meet the ever growing needs of a growing Philippine population, we   need to continually increase productivity. But in doing so, we must also   insure sustainability, both ecologically and economically.</p>
              <p>Agri-Pinoy&rsquo;s emphasis on sustainable   agricultural and fisheries principles and practices takes into account   the limited bio-physical carrying capacity of the Philippines, while   investing to expand the capacity of our human resources.</p>
              <p>We must insure that producers and other   stakeholders in the whole value chain &ldquo;from farm to table&rdquo; receive   economic benefits that enable them to sustain their participation.</p>
              <p><strong>Natural resource management.</strong> In line with our goals of self-reliance and sustainability, Agri-Pinoy   focuses on the natural resource endowments of the Philippines, and how   to manage them so that they are not exhausted, while enhancing their   competitive advantage.</p>
              <p>We seek to optimize rather than merely maximize the development of our natural resources.</p>
              <p><strong>Local development.</strong> The   devolution of governance and the recognition of an eco-system framework   of development reinforce the Agri-Pinoy guiding principle of local   development.</p>
              <p>While all outputs can be aggregated to   calculate the total contribution of agriculture and fisheries to   national development, Agri-Pinoy gives due emphasis to the contribution   of agriculture and fisheries to local development.</p>
              <p>These four guiding principles of   Agri-Pinoy are interrelated and overlap. Together, they also provide   agriculture and fisheries in the Philippines a better chance to face the   two major challenges of climate change and changes in the global   market.</p>
              <p>The Agri-Pinoy Check List</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Broad-based</li>
                <li>From Farm to Table</li>
                <li>Sustainable systems</li>
                <li>Resilience</li>
                <li>Partnership</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Broad-based. At the heart of Agri-Pinoy   is a commitment to a broad-based strategy for the growth and development   of agriculture and fisheries.</p>
              <p>Why is a broad-based strategy needed?   Agricultural and rural development must start from the reality that   through agrarian reform, majority of our farms are family-sized or even   smaller.</p>
              <p>This need not be a disadvantage since there are enough evidence that small farm systems can be as productive as large farms.</p>
              <p>In fact, at their current level of   productivity, the small producers still contribute the biggest   percentage of production in agriculture and fisheries.</p>
              <p>A broad-based strategy calls for   equitable and proportional allocation of DA services and resources to   small, medium, and big players. From the 30-35 per cent who have been   traditionally reached by DA services, we need to reach out to the   majority who are small producers.</p>
              <p>The other implication is that we need to   take account of the different stakeholders in the whole value chain,   and adopt specific and appropriate interventions to different   stakeholders</p>
              <p>Broad-based refers not only to size but   also to diversity of crops and production systems. This is important for   flexibility and resilience in the face of climate change and changes in   global trading system. There are many downsides to large-scale   monoculture, not just because of the impact on biodiversity but also   because of disproportionate risks.</p>
              <p><strong>From Farm to Table.</strong> Agri-Pinoy addresses the whole system, from production to consumption.   Both supply-side management and demand-side management are needed.</p>
              <p>Instead of looking mainly into   production, we need to pay attention to the whole value chain. This   includes good soil and water management, and improved seeds. The   community seed-banking program seeks to encourage local seed growers to   produce certified seeds and farmers to use them. The extension system   needs to be revitalized through the massive retraining of technicians   and farmers themselves.</p>
              <p>The policy of the DA is to devote public   resources to those items that the farmers cannot take care of, like   irrigation systems, infrastructure, post-harvest facilities, and other   public goods.</p>
              <p>But the DA also has responsibility to   insure food safety and quality, primarily through our regulatory   function. We also need to promote responsible consumption.</p>
              <p><strong>Sustainable farming and fisheries systems.</strong> The need to integrate sustainability into efforts to increase   productivity is well established. The challenge is to provide our   primary producers information and assistance so that they can adopt and   develop innovative technologies and management systems.</p>
              <p>As mentioned earlier, the requirements   of sustainability are both ecological and economic. But there is a third   element that is even more challenging – insuring the successor   generation to our aging farming and fishing population.</p>
              <p>The Gulayan sa Paaralan project with the   Department of Education seeks to develop an appreciation for   agriculture from an early age. We also need to review and draw lessons   from programs like the 4-H clubs and Future Farmers Clubs.</p>
              <p>But to enhance the appeal of farming and   fishing, we must also communicate well their income prospects, as well   as promote a social appreciation of the role of farmers and fishers. We   need to develop role models of farmer-technicians, farmer-scientists,   and farmer-entrepreneurs.</p>
              <p><strong>Resilience.</strong> Although   implicit in the concept of sustainability, we give resilience a distinct   emphasis because of the increased impacts of climate change and changes   in the global market.</p>
              <p>These actual and potential impacts have   to be integrated into any agricultural and fisheries development plan.   We also need to combine satellite mapping of vulnerabilities with soil   suitability and market analysis.</p>
              <p>One key strategy is the empowerment of   farmers and fishers, including provision of timely and useful   information about climate change and market change. This can help them   shift back from a situation of uncertainty to calculable risks.</p>
              <p>In addition, they must be assisted to diversify options and introduced to adaptive technologies.</p>
              <p><strong>Partnerships.</strong> The promotion and development of Agri-Pinoy calls for partnerships at various levels.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Partnerships with national agencies.</strong> Our starting   partnership is with the members of the National Convergence Initiative   which is chaired by the DA – the Department of Agrarian Reform and the   department of Environment and Natural Resources. However, other national   agencies may come into this partnership.<br>
                  <br>
                  The NCI has adopted an   ecosystem approach to rural development and governance: From ridge,   through river, to reef. We bring to it our commitment to a broad-based   approach favoring small producers and farms, but using information and   organization to achieve the needed scale in planning and marketing,   &ldquo;from farm to table.&rdquo;</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Partnerships with local governments.</strong> Devolution   demands this. We need to work with the DILG to assist LGUs to integrate   agriculture and fisheries into their local development plans. This calls   for technical assistance and capacity building, and strategic project   partnerships.</li>
                <li><strong>Partnerships with NGOs and people&rsquo;s organizations.</strong> The two or more million farmers and fishers are the backbone of the   production system. They need to be organized and also developed to   become farmer-technicians, farmer-scientists, and farmer-entrepreneurs.   To accomplish this, we need to partner with rural development NGOs who   are willing to work within a shared Agri-Pinoy framework.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Partnerships with the private sector.</strong> Our   Agri-Pinoy framework of &ldquo;farm to table&rdquo; requires that we partner with   many stakeholders, and the private sector play crucial roles across the   whole value chain. In addition, it is government policy to promote   public-private partnerships especially in larger projects.<br>
                  <br>
                  In   forging partnerships, we follow the principle of diversity. We are open   to work with different organizations and even different political   persuasions, so long as they are willing to enter into principled   partnerships, based on the principles of Agri-Pinoy.<br>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Challenges to the DA Family</strong></p>
              <p>Agri-Pinoy represents both continuity   and change. It affirms the DA&rsquo;s mandate and mission, and the various   laws that we are tasked to implement.</p>
              <p>But Agri-Pinoy also requires change.</p>
              <p>Convergence within the DA family. First   of all, we need to achieve convergence within the DA family. Convergence   means alignment to the principles of Agri-Pinoy and the goals of the   DA.</p>
              <p>This convergence within the DA has to   happen at the national level, and at the regional level. I reiterate my   earlier call for the regional directors to lead the RMCs in developing   their respective regional Agri-Pinoy frameworks, and aligning their   programs to this framework.</p>
              <p>Professionalism within the DA family.   While we talk of cooperating as a family and community, we need to hold   one another to agreed upon professional and ethical standards for mutual   accountability to one another, and to the general public.</p>
              <p>Good Governance. In line with President   Aquino&rsquo;s call for good governance, we must insure transparency and   accountability in the DA. But also synergy, using all forms of   participation that will optimize the use of our resources to achieve our   goals.</p>
              <p><strong>Bridge the gap. Touch the heart.</strong></p>
              <p>Let me end by reiterating the initial call of Agri-Pinoy to &ldquo;bridge the gap and touch the heart.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Our stakeholders, especially the   grassroots, must experience our sincerity and concern, so that they will   trust us and respond to our call to actively participate in Agri-Pinoy. </p>
